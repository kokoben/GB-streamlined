## GB-Streamlined

[demo](http://gb-streamlined.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

A clone of [Giant Bomb](https://www.giantbomb.com/), a popular video game website driven by user-submitted content. This responsive web app contains only the video content of the site that I most frequently use. Videos are sorted into three different categories, and are listed in descending order  by publishing date - just like on the main website. Users may also search for videos based on keywords.
